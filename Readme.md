## 1. Project Analysis  

### 1.1 Final User Profile  

My final user is a **recruiter or human resources manager** who wants to quickly and visually understand my **technical skills, professional experience, and personality**.  
This type of user has limited time, reviews many profiles daily, and expects a **clear, professional, and well-structured website** that provides an immediate impression of who I am and what I can offer.  

**User Persona:**  
- **Name:** Laura García  
- **Age:** 35–45 years old  
- **Profession:** Recruiter / HR Manager at a tech company or consulting firm.  
- **Goal:** Quickly evaluate whether the candidate fits the position both technically and personally.  
- **Expectations:**  
  - The website should be **quick to read** and **visually appealing**.  
  - Clear sections: *personal profile, skills, experience, portfolio, and contact*.  
  - A **professional and consistent design**, without excessive decoration.  
  - Easy access to a **downloadable CV** and **contact options** (LinkedIn, email, etc.).

### 1.2 Information Architecture  

The website is designed as a **single-page layout**, organized from top to bottom as follows:  
1. Hero / Quick introduction (name, role, tagline).  
2. About Me (short bio, photo).  
3. Professional Experience.  
4. Education and Certifications.  
5. Skills & Technical Competencies.  
6. Contact Section (form or links to email/LinkedIn).  

This order allows a recruiter to navigate through the entire profile smoothly and get a full picture of the candidate without switching pages.
